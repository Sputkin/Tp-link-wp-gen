# Tp-link-default-password-generator
This simple script , generate a wordlist of all the possible passwords used by default from almost all tp-link router models. Once the wordlist is generated, you can use it with aircrack-ng . 

The script was created for the sole purpose of teaching , so I'm not assuming any responsibility if it is used to harm people or computer systems .
